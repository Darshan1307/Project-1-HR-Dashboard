This project showcases a well-designed data analysis dashboard created in Power BI. 
It covers importing and cleaning data, creating visuals, adding insights, and exporting the final product.

Skills Demonstrated:

exploration of Power BI
Data import and cleaning methodologies
Creative visualization design and storytelling through charts and tables
KPI formulation and insightful data interpretation
Exporting and sharing dashboards for effective communication

Steps:

Data Cleaning and Transformation: Preprocess the data to ensure accuracy and consistency, including error correction, missing value handling, and data manipulation workflows.
Visualization Design: Design meaningful and engaging visuals to represent key metrics and trends. Describe your thought process behind each visual choice and how it supports the story you want to tell.
KPI Development: Define key performance indicators (KPIs) aligned with your analysis goals and present them effectively within the dashboard.
Insights and Recommendations: Integrate data-driven insights and actionable recommendations based on your visualizations and KPIs.
Dashboard Refinement: Iterate and refine the dashboard based on user feedback or your own analysis evolution.
Sharing and Reporting: Export the final dashboard in a suitable format for distribution and discussion. Describe your intended audience and communication objectives.
